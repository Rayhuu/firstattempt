This is the code that scraping business articles' data from WSJ from Mrach 15th to April 15th. The funtion contains several loops. To each page, rely on beautifulsoup4, I collected information include ariticle's title, author, date and summary, then put all data into csv file to do more analytics. Then, I added a loop to make sure the previous step will contiune process until all target pages was collected.
